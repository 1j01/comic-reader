# Rezzy: Zoom and Enhance for images on the web ðŸ”Žâœ¨

Webcomic [Zoom and Enhance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhF_56SxrGk).

Sometimes the text in a web comic is a little too small to read comfortably.  
Zooming in normally makes the text blurry, so it's not much help.  

Rezzy is a browser extension that automatically enhances the resolution of images on the web,
using machine learning.

Powered by [waifu2x-converter-cpp][]

Machine learning is cool, but it's important to make it *accessible*, and get it into the hands of the masses.

**Bonus feature:** navigate any web comic with arrow keys
