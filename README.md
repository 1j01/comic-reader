## Development Setup

- Install Git if you don't already have it.
- [Install Git Large File Storage][git lfs install] if you don't have it.
- [Clone the repo.][git clone]
- Install [Node.js][] if you don't have it, then open up a command prompt / terminal in the project directory.
- Install project dependencies with `npm install`
- In Google Chrome, type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar
- Turn on Developer mode
- Click "Load unpacked" and select the root of this repository as the folder
- Start the superresolution server with `npm start`
- Visit [Unsounded](http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch01/ch01_01.html) because it's the only comic (or site) enabled for superresolution for now. (There's no user-controlled site enabling/disabling yet, and I don't want it to apply EVERYWHERE.)
