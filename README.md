Built with:
- [waifu2x-converter-cpp](https://github.com/DeadSix27/waifu2x-converter-cpp)
- Electron
- Electron Forge

## Development Setup

- [Clone the repo.](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
- Install [Node.js][] if you don't have it, then open up a command prompt / terminal in the project directory.
- Install project dependencies with `npm i`
- Start the electron app with `npm start`

[electron-debug][] and [devtron][] are included, so you can use <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd> to reload and <kbd>F12</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd> to open the devtools, and there's a Devtron tab with tools specific to Electron, such as an IPC message inspector.

You can build for production with `npm run make`
